**Minimum-weight feedback edge set.** 

A *feedback edge set* of a graph is a subset of edges that contains at least one edge from every cycle in the graph. If the edges of a feedback edge set are removed, the resulting graph is acyclic. Given an edge-weighted graph, design an efficient algorithm to find a feedback edge set of minimum weight. Assume the edge weights are positive.
