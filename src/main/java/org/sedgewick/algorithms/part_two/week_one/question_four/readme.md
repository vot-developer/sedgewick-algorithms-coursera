**Shortest directed cycle.** 

Given a digraph *G*, design an efficient algorithm to find a directed cycle with the minimum number of edges (or report that the graph is acyclic).
The running time of your algorithm should be at most proportional to **V(E + V)** and use space proportional to **E + V**, where **V** is the number of vertices and **E** is the number of edges.
