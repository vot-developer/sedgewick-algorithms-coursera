**Tandem repeat.** 

A tandem repeat of a base string **b** within a string **s** is a substring of **s** consisting of at least one consecutive copy of the base string **b**. Given **b** and **s**, design an algorithm to find a tandem repeat of **b** within **s** of maximum length. Your algorithm should run in time proportional to **M+N**, where **M** is length of **b** and **N** is the length ss.

For example, if **s** is "abcabcababcaba" and **b** is "abcab", then "abcababcab" is the tandem substring of maximum length (2 copies).
