**Cyclic rotation of a string.** 

A string **s** is a cyclic rotation of a string **t** if **s** and **t** have the same length and **s** consists of a suffix of **t** followed by a prefix of **t**. For example, "winterbreak" is a cyclic rotation of "breakwinter" (and vice versa). Design a linear-time algorithm to determine whether one string is a cyclic rotation of another.
