**Successor with delete.** 

Given a set of **n** integers **S={0,1,...,n−1}** and a sequence of requests of the following form:

* Remove **x** from **S**
* Find the successor of **x**: the smallest **y** in **S** such that **y≥x**.

design a data type so that all operations (except construction) take logarithmic time or better in the worst case.
